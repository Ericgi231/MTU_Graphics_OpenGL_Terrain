--- SELECTING AN ASSIMP VERSION ---

Any recent version of assimp should work. Versions as old as 4.1.0
should work on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
   

--- LINUX INSTRUCTIONS ---

First try installing ASSIMP via your distributions package manager. On
many systems, you will need to install both the library and the
associated headers (for example libassimp3 and libassimp-dev).

If you decide to compile it yourself:
Download it from the website listed above
Extract files
cmake .
make

If you encounter problems compiling assimp 3.2, try changing "cmake ."
to "cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF ."

Next, use one of the following two options:
 1) Run "sudo make install" to install ASSIMP into /usr/local
 2) Edit opengl-examples/CMakeModules/FindASSIMP.txt so that this software can find your copy of the library.


--- macOS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Install homebrew and run "brew install assimp"


--- WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS ---

Download ASSIMP source code. Ensure that you have CMake and Visual Studio installed.

Run cmake-gui

Set the root directory of the ASSIMP source code to be "where is the source code:" and "where to build the binaries:".

Click "Configure". Select Visual Studio and native compilers. Any red warning messages about Qt being missing can be ignored.

Click "Generate".

"Open Project" with Visual Studio.

Right click on the "assimp" solution and select "Build". If you try to build the ALL_BUILD solution and didn't set ASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF in cmake, then ALL_BUILD may not work correctly.

Refer back to WINDOWS-VisualStudio.txt to get opengl-examples to work with your library.
